*Fast as C, slick as Ruby*

Exploring & Learning Crystal Language with code examples and augment the documentation.

https://crystal-lang.org/

== Installation

On MacOS - use:
```bash
$ brew install crystal
```

For all other systems see: https://crystal-lang.org/install/

== link:crystal_cli.html[Crystal CLI]

* Useful commands when using crystal
* My most useful command while developing is:
```
crystal run src/file_name.cr
```
== Blocks

== Macros _(Sort-of Meta-Code)_

== Data Structures

=== link:crystal_structs.html[Structs]

* Structs _(& Records)_ are immutable data structures - these are `safe` when used in a concurrent/parallel context.

=== JSON Data

== Code Patterns

=== Decorator

=== Value Object

=== East Oriented _(Fluent Interface)_

=== HTTP (Server and Client)

Non-stateful - short-term connections over TCP.

=== HTTP (Server and Client)

Encrypted HTTP Interactions

==== WebSockets with SSL

==== WebSockets with Named Channels


== Concurrency & Parallelism

An intro into the basics of how things like websockets work

=== link:crystal_concurrency_basics.html[Concurrency Basics]

* Basics on starting processes concurrently

=== link:crystal_concurrent_objects.html[Concurrent Objects]

* Examples of using concurrency with objects

=== link:crystal_channels_async_messaging.html[Channels _(Async Messaging)_]

* Channels allow us to safely communicate between concurrent processes.
* To safely share data/state send immutable data only **(Structs are a good option)**.

=== link:crystal_channel_buffers.html[Channel Buffers]

* What to do when messages come faster than collected

=== link:crystal_channel_callbacks.html[Channel Callbacks]

* Safely share state information when its available

=== Crystal Promises

=== Crystal Priority Queues

=== link:crystal_parallelism.html[Parallelism]

* Compiling to use multiple CPUs (add `-Dpreview_mt`) to the compile command

=== Actor Model

* Using macros to build async message sending, callbacks and state sharing.
