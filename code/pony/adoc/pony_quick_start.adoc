== Intro

```bash
$ brew install ponyc
```

* Every Pony Project must be in a folder - the name of the folder will be the default name of the compiled code.
* Every Pony Project must minimally have a `Main` actor (will be described in detail shortly) -- so I suggest naming that file `main.pony`
* Compile with `ponyc`
* Run with the `./project_name`

== Hello World

* We need to make a project folder:
```bash
$ mkdir hello_world
```

* We need a `Main` actor:
```bash
$ cat <<EOF > hello_world/main.pony
actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    env.out.print("Hello, World!")
EOF
```

* Lets compile our hello_world:
```bash
ponyc hello_world
```

* Now lets run our hello_world:

```bash
$ ./hello_world/hello_world
```
