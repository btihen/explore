Actors

The concurrency in Pony is based on Actors, just like in Erlang. Actors in Pony can, unlike classes, have behaviours (asynchronous methods)

Behaviours are asynchronous, but actors themselves are sequential. Actors will only execute a single behaviour at the same time.

```pony
//mascot/main.pony
actor Main
  let mascot: Mascot

  new create(env: Env) =>
    mascot = Mascot("Go gopher")

    env.out.print(mascot.message())

class Mascot
  let _name: String

  new create(name: String) =>
    _name = name

  fun message(): String =>
    "The " + _name + " is the best mascot!"
```
