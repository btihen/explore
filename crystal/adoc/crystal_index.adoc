*Fast as C, slick as Ruby*

Exploring & Learning Crystal Language with code examples and augment the documentation.

https://crystal-lang.org/

== Installation

On MacOS - use:
```bash
$ brew install crystal
```

For all other systems see: https://crystal-lang.org/install/

== link:crystal_cli.html[Crystal CLI]

* Useful commands when using crystal
* My most useful command while developing is:
```
crystal run src/file_name.cr
```

== Structs & Records

=== link:crystal_structs.html[Structs]

* Structs _(& Records)_ are immutable data structures - these are `safe` when used in a concurrent/parallel context.

=== link:crystal_records.html[Records]

* Structs _(& Records)_ are immutable data structures - these are `safe` when used in a concurrent/parallel context.


== link:crystal_websockets.html[WebSockets]

Making long-lived client-server connections over a TCP.

== Concurrency & Parallelism

An intro into the basics of how things like websockets work

Augment and adapt content using inspiration from: https://blog.golang.org/pipelines

=== link:crystal_concurrency_basics.html[Concurrency Basics]

* Basics on starting processes concurrently

=== link:crystal_concurrent_objects.html[Concurrent Objects]

* Examples of using concurrency with objects

=== link:crystal_channels_async_messaging.html[Channels _(Async Messaging)_]

* Channels allow us to safely communicate between concurrent processes.
* To safely share data/state send immutable data only **(Structs are a good option)**.

=== link:crystal_channel_buffers.html[Channel Buffers]

* What to do when messages come faster than collected

=== link:crystal_channel_callbacks.html[Channel Callbacks]

* Safely share state information when its available

=== Crystal Promises 

* See: https://github.com/spider-gazelle/promise

=== link:crystal_parallelism.html[Parallelism]

* Compiling to use multiple CPUs (add `-Dpreview_mt`) to the compile command


=== Actor Model _**(not done)**_

* Using macros to build async message sending, callbacks and state sharing.

== TO-DOs

* Add Macros
* Write Channel Buffering
* Reseach Promises in Crystal
* Finish Callbacks & (Notification)
* Research/Add Crystal Value Objects
* Build a Macro to make a simple Actor Class
* Add Parallelism (Ideally with WebSockets example -- to extend `chat`)
* Add, review, augment and adapt content using: https://blog.golang.org/pipelines
